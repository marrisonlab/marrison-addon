## Description

**Marrison Addon** is a lightweight plugin designed to enhance Elementor Containers by adding a "Wrapped Link" functionality. This allows you to make an entire container clickable, improving user experience for cards, banners, and other block-level elements.

**Key Features:**

*   **Seamless Integration:** Adds a "Wrapped Link" section directly to the **Advanced** tab of Elementor Container elements.
*   **Dynamic Links:** Fully supports Elementor's dynamic tags, allowing you to link to post URLs, custom fields, and more.
*   **Lightweight:** Minimal impact on performance, adding only necessary attributes and a small script.
*   **Admin Notices:** Checks for Elementor dependency and alerts administrators if it's missing.

1.  Upload the `marrison-addon` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
2.  Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3.  Ensure Elementor is installed and activated.
4.  Go to the Elementor editor, select a Container, navigate to the **Advanced** tab, and configure the **Wrapped Link**.
